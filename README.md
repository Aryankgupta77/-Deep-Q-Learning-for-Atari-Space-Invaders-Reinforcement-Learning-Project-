# -Deep-Q-Learning-for-Atari-Space-Invaders-Reinforcement-Learning-Project-
In this project, I implemented a reinforcement learning agent capable of playing the Atari game Space Invaders using Deep Q-Learning (DQN). The goal was to design an agent that could learn effective strategies purely from pixel inputs and rewards, without any predefined rules.
